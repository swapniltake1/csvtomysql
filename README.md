## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) installed (at least Java 8).
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) installed and running.
- Basic knowledge of Spring Boot, Spring Batch, and MySQL.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
bash
git clone https://github.com/swapniltake1/csvtomysql.git
```

## Project Structure

The project structure follows standard Spring Boot conventions:

- `src/main/java`: Contains the Java source code.
- `src/main/resources`: Contains configuration files, including the application.properties file for database configuration.
- `src/test`: Contains test classes.

## Configuration

Before running the application, configure the MySQL database connection in the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your-database-name
spring.datasource.username=your-username
spring.datasource.password=your-password
spring.datasource.driverClassName=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
```

You can also customize other batch-related configurations in this file.

## Running the Application

To run the application, use the following commands:

```bash
./mvnw clean package
java -jar target/spring-boot-batch-csv-to-mysql-1.0.0.jar
```

Replace `spring-boot-batch-csv-to-mysql-1.0.0.jar` with the actual JAR file generated.

The application will read data from a sample CSV file (`data.csv`), process it, and store it in the configured MySQL database.
